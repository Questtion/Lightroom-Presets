# Lightroom-Presets
A collection of presets that is for anyone, by me!
I am an amateur, so don't expect God's gift to presets to be among these. I have decided to make this repository as a way to give back to the photography community as well as, give myself an oppourtunity to make new presets.

To add a preset to lightroom go File > Import Profiles and Presets then select the preset(s) you would wish to import then they should be avaliable under the preset tab in lightroom.
